# Advanced Computing Concepts Project 
# Web_Search_Engine


## Introduction

In simple terms, search engines are response machines. They discover and catalogue all the material assessible on the Internet through crawling and indexing. All the results are then sorted and ranked based on the best match
The Crawlers/Spiders are search engine programs that start by finding web pages and then hopping through a path of links and web pages to find new content

### Features Used

For the implementation of Web Search Engine, we will apply these concepts including the following:
- Pattern Matching
- Indexing
- Edit Distance Algorithm
- Occurences of Words
- Parsing
- Search Engine Process

### Prerequisites


- [JAVA] (https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
- [Git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Eclipse] (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [Jsoup] (https://jsoup.org/download/)

### Installing


The steps are:
 1. [Setting up Eclipse Environment](#step-1---setting-up-eclipse-environment)
 2. [Cloning the Application](#step-2---cloning-the-application)
 3. [Downloading necessary Java Libraries](#step-3---downloading-necessary-Java-Libraries)
 5. [Running the App](#step-4---running-the-app)


### Step 1 - Setting up Eclipse Environment


- After installing the Eclipse IDE for the respective OS, launch the IDE.


### Step 2 - Cloning the Application

- Extract project .zip file or
- In the terminal type the following command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AnishaGharat/Web_Search_Engine.git
```

This command will pull the latest project files from git repository.


### Step 3 - Downloading necessary Java Libraries 


- Create a new project in Eclipse using the path of the cloned or extracted source codes.

- For installing the required libraries, you require jsoup jar file. 

- Under the project configurations in Eclipse > Add External JAR files, set the relative path of the Jsoup JAR file (check pre-requisites).


### Step 4 - Running the App

In the Eclipse IDE, open a new terminal and run the Java Application.


## Versioning
